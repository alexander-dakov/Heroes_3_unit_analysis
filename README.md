# Heroes_3_unit_analysis
A data science project on analysis and prediction of features of "Heroes of Might and Magic III" creatures.
The goal is to reverse engineer the data into finding a formula which is responsible for important unit behaviour.
Features are cherry-picked by common logic, and so is forming of subsets of data used to fit linear regression models in search of the formula.
